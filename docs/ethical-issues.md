# Ethical Issues - HealthTrackerAI

## Overview 
HealthTrackerAI helps users monitor their health, diet, and exercise with AI generated insights. Since our system collects personal information, it's critical to consider the ethical responsibilities tied to privacy, fairness, and potential misuse. 

## 1. User Privacy and Data Ethics
- We collect sensitive data (name, age, weight, height, and gender.).
- All data will be stored securely and used **only for personalized wellness recommandations**.
- We provide transparency by explaining what data is collected and why. 
- Users can delete their data and close their account at any time. 

## 2. Avoiding Algorithmic Bias 
- While we collect limited deographic information, our algorithms **do not use race, religion, or other unrelated attributes** in any calculations.
- Gender and age are used **only to improve health and fitness accuracy**, not to treat users differently. 
- We regulary will test our AI-generated recommendations to identify and correct any potential biases.
- Our goal is to ensure that **all users receive fair, inclusive, and evidence-based results**, regardless of background.

## 3. Promoting Fair and Ethical Use
- The software is designed for personal health tracking **not for medical diagnosis** or comparison between users.
- We discourage misuse that could harm or shame others based on their health data.
